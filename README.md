This is a project I worked on when first learning Java. I got experience with the four pillars of OOP as well as switch statements and code refactoring. 

It features a very simple log in/out system and playlist creation and deletion. Songs can also be "plaayed" which just involves printing the title and the author.

The program must take in a source file containing all of the songs the user wishes to handle.
